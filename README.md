# MLREGEX-MNIST
## Demo showing the use of MLREGEX Machine-Learned Regular Expressions to match the MNIST image dataset.


### USES REGEXES MACHINE LEARNED with MLREGEX, see [MLREGEX](https://www.mlregex.com/About) 

 Note: For an additional challenge, we swapped the MNIST Test and Training Set.
 These Machine Learned Regexes was learned/trained on the smaller MNIST "Test" set (10000)
 and it generalizes, with 100% accuracy, to the larger MNIST "Training" set (60000).
                                                                           
  You can see the MLREGEX Machine Learned Regexes in the file: MNISTRegexes.cs
  See the method "button3_MatchWithRegex_Click()" below, for the code using the Regexes.
                                                                           
 For Demonstration Purposes we added matching with Regex Functionality, here to the MnistViewer program.
 To do the setup for MnistViewer part requirements:
    See [MnistViewer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2014/june/test-run-working-with-the-mnist-image-recognition-data-set)

 MnistViewer is a WinForm program for MSDN Magazine article "Image Recognition with the MNIST Data Set"
 You must get, download, and unzip the two MNIST data files below.
